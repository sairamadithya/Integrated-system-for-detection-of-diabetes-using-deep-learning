This project is about the development of an integrated diagnostic system for diabetes using deep learning. Fundus imaging, thermal imaging of the foot, dermal imaging and OCT are the different imaging modalities considered for this project. The CNN algorithms were developed and trained on public datasets. The website was developed using streamlit and hosted via streamlit share.
